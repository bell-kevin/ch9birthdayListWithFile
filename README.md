# ch9birthdayListWithFile

Write a project that produces a list of names and birthdays in date order and in name order. Use a 10-element array of either structures or class objects (your choice) that each holds 3 string variables, "firstName", "lastName", and "birthday", which is in the format of MM/DD. Fill the array by reading the data in this birthdays.txt fileDownload this birthdays.txt file. It contains 10 lines of data, with the person's first name then last name then birthday on the same line. Once the data has been read in and stored in the array, display it as the original list. Sort it in ascending order by last name and display it, then sort it in ascending date order and display it. Use functions to (1) read in and store the data in the array, (2) sort by name, (3) sort by date, and (4) display the array.

Take a screenshot of the results, which should look like this:

== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project. I have a [website](https://bellKevin.me) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign 
from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not 
a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
email me at **bellKevin@pm.me** for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
